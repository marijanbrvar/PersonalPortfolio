I"m<p>Here is a Capstone project built with Ruby on Rails. Project ideas are coming from a redesign suggestion of Twitter.</p>

<p>Users log in only with a username (proper authentication was not a requirement)
Before a user logs in, they can only see the Log in/Sign up page
When they log in, they have full access to the app
Users can create opinions/tweets
Users can follow other users
The discover page shows the most recent opinions/tweets from users that the logged-in user does not follow
The app is an MVP of the product - with the graphical design, including essential features, with the possibility to extend.</p>
